3. Input your credentials into Themer and "Get Started".

4. To create a theme, give it a name, choose the types of styles you want to include, and pull from you current page or entire file. Any styles you capture must be the canvas AND must be published.

5. Repeat the process to create subsequent themes. Your styles must share the same names in each them for them to be matched.
